## Description

Here, I try to use Dynamic Graph Networks to improve prediction of Cancer Drug Response (ic50 values). I also test out the effects that including protein and gene expression data has on the accuracy of my model and experiment with various autoencoding methods to see which models provide the most effective encoding.
